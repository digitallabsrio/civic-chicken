  "course_name": "Grokking the Low Level Design Interview Using OOD Principles - Learn Interactively",
  "course_overview": "With hundreds of potential problems to design, preparing for the object-oriented design (OOD) interview can feel like a daunting task. However, with a strategic approach, OOD interview prep doesn’t have to take more than a few weeks. \n\nIn this course, you’ll learn the fundamentals of object-oriented design with an extensive set of real-world problems to help you prepare for the OOD part of a typical software engineering interview process at major tech companies like Apple, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon.\n\nBy the end of this course, you will get an understanding of the essential object-oriented concepts like design principles and patterns to ace the OOD interview. You will develop the ability to efficiently breakdown an interview design problem into multiple parts using a bottom-up approach. You will be familiar with the scope of each interview problem by accurately defining the requirements and presenting its solution using class, use case, sequence, and activity diagrams.",
